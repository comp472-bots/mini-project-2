# ðŸ§  COMP 472 Mini-Project 2

by Domenic Labbate (40063296) and Gianluca Lepore (40064389)

## Overview

This repository consists of a "line-em-up" game. For faster runtime, we use `pypy3`

## Instructions

The code can be run as a single game, or programatically to generate output files.

1. To play a single game, enter the following command `pypy3 line-em-up.py`

2. To play the game programatically, enter the following command: ``pypy3 line-em-up.py --output`. This will
   also generate the output files.
